# Plugin showcase (Raw HTML)

If you trust the input and you want to use raw HTML, you can use the [rehype-raw](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw) plugin.

> The [CommonMark specification](https://spec.commonmark.org/) allows raw HTML by default, but this library doesn't allow raw HTML by default. This is because raw HTML has potential security issues.
