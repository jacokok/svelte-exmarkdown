# Plugin showcase (Math formula)

If you want to render math formula, you can use [remark-math](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math) and [rehype-katex](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main/packages/rehype-katex) plugins.
Offcourse, you can use [rehype-mathjax](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main/packages/rehype-mathjax) instead of rehype-katex.
